                            <p> - Do you spend it on thingsand then use paycheck money to play, - or do you save cash in your house safe (seen some Instagram stories of people doing that), - or maybe you invest it in monthly income producing assets? (Or maybe something else?) If by any chance you're one of the investors in Canada, the poker income that you use to invest, is it taxable? I know non professional poker players in Canada don't have to declare the poker income but I'm not yet familiar how it works with investme. 
I joined a year ago and havent had to rebuy to a poker site since. When I donk out I can take surveys. Recently I even got  from buying a com through GoDaddy. You can get credits through Netflix and more. Great. Okay, no, I didn't win an EPT bracelet or anything like that. I am profitable, to the tune of 0 over the past year, but that's -nothing-. What IS something, however, is that over the past year, in order to afford, bankroll-managementwise, games like /2 NLHE and /20 LO8, is that I've been putting money into a savings account specifically for poker every month. I've saved enough in that bankroll, actually, to make a down payment (after FHA) on a condominium. So I'm going https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzlbvZ5ZRU. I started a separate poker club for it, since it's really the only way to do this, details below. We're just gonna keep everything in this sub since I don't think we'll have that many people and it's all related and I don't think the other mods will give a shit since we don't have that many posts anyway. This is how it's gonna work for now, but it may change. I've set up a gmail account account it's my reddit name @gmail.com and set up a paypal account. Everyone that wants I currently want to bank some of my bankroll and tie it up in a savings account, about ¬£3k. Now I know that shouldnt be a problem but it got me thinking about the next time I want to deposit some more money. How do I prove my money is legit and not drug/crime money or do I even have to? I can vouch for a lot of my winnings from casinos which I had to sign for at the cash desk, but I also have a lot from home games, casino cash games and underground games. Would there be any problem? Hi, first time posting here and just wanted some advice. I am a single 24 year old male living at home with my parents in San Jose, Ca. In Dec 2012 I graduated with a BS in econ and decided to play poker for a while. It was pretty good money, but I wanted to do something else. I enrolled in an accounting program and finished a few months ago. Got offered a job at a public accounting firm for 55k and I requested to start in Oct 2015 so I have time to study for my CPA. I will most likely So last Friday I, well actually my dad, was paid my Full Tilt Poker account balance from 2011. Read more about Full Tilt and Black Friday here ( He received the money because the Full Tilt Poker account I was playing on was technically under his name (long story - has to do with creating a rakeback account). Question #1: What's the best / proper 
I have recently begun keeping track of my SO's poker wins in a second savings account in my name. This is not in response to any kind of conflict over money spending, he just wanted an easier, more tangible way to keep track of his spending/winning. If he comes out on top, he gives me 75% of that in cash and I deposit it into the account. What do I need to know about the pros and cons of this? Is there a better way to save accumulated funds? When do I need to worry about it becoming questionable. Hey guys, sorry for posting here, but I couldn't think of anywhere else to post. I had put a little bit of money on Lock poker just to mess with for fun. This was back when I had a laptop, but now all I rock is the Chromebook. This means I can't install any programs, including Lock poker. Now I know I only have .11 on there, but it's just wasting away otherwise because it's too little to withdraw and I can't install lock poker. Might as well get let someone use it But I can do is transfe. I have about  in my black chip poker account looking to sell for 1.3 BTC at current rate. I can transfer funds player to player. If you have an account on the client. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_OLR9Mh9jQ My r/poker people, I made a video talking more about what you can do when your friends/family think you're a degenerate because you play poker/gamble. I would love to get feedback from some of you on how you've dealt with this because I imagine that most regulars of this forum aren't hardcore professional poker players. For myself, once I bought my first car with poker money and a couple months later moved out to San Diego, most of the people This is a continuation of my meta game/ strategy advice for LLSNL players. Please note that this advice is geared towards serious-recreational players. Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/788h6e/advice_for_the_weekend_warrior/ ampnbsp; I‚Äôm going to continue listing random ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù I‚Äôve read/heard in various places (R/poker, CLP forums, Rob Farha‚Äôs Podcast, and Tommy Angelo‚Äôs books) in no particular order: ampnbsp; Get comfortable playing big pots. Hi everyone. I've been playing poker for about 10 years. I was a winning online player right before and after Black Friday. I quit playing to focus on my business, which I started with poker money üòé. Now business is good and I have plenty of money to play 1-2 2-5. I'm wondering if it's even worth it to play. I keep on hearing about all the pros from back in the day going broke. What's going on? Is it not possible to come up playing cards anymore at all or do they have other issues like bankro. 
I'm curious how do you manage your money? I heard people have the "life money" and the "poker money" and use a certain % of the money per session. Or something like that. Any tips on bankroll management? Using examples would be great too. Also, did you actually save up BIG thanks to poker winnings? I think I remember one Omaha Chinese man saying that he bought his house for cash only, all made through poker. I've met him just a few times so I have no idea what his initial bankroll Edit: A week and a half, not two, oops, but whatever, I fucking suck at everything I do, but the date and time is correct. Anyone is welcome! If you want to join the SEPARATE cash poker club, post in here and I'll explain how you can join, but basically it's sent to my PayPal account or BITCOIN, yes BITCOIN account (if sent bitcoin, you get what you sent me back in bitcoin as long as it was set at  USD AT THE TIME it was sent, so if you win, it might be more or less that actual  USD since. </p>
